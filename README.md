## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)

### What I learned

I learned how to mantain a global state, how to update the title when toggling
the bonus section.

I also learned how to make use of `box-shadow` and some other stuff like radial
gradient, count clicks, but reset them when a second after the last click
passes.

Also I like how to position the buttons, it wasn't the best solution but it
worked in this case, so it's fine

### Continued development

I would like to improve the position of the buttons and mantain the state after
refreshing the browser, because I've missed that part.
